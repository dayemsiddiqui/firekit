- This project uses the latest version of AdonisJS with React on the frontend with the help of inertiaJS
- Whenever you are not sure how to implement something look up the web for the lastest version and best practice guidelines on how to implement it in AdonisJS
- Whenever you make any changes in the project, please always write/update tests for it.-
- The frontend is using SHADCN and tailwindcss with React
- Always try to build the project after the changes and ensure it doesnt have any build or type errors
- Always run tests after finishing your work to ensure that everything works as expected and you havent broken anything-
- Ensure end to end type safety by always using InferPageProps, DO NOT Redefine or redeclare the duplicate types on the frontend as it ruins end to end type safety

- Since we use React with InertiaJS on the frontned, whenever you are writing tests for controller ensure that you create appropiate asserts and test cases to cater the inertiajs response from the controller which return a inertiaJS reponse

- When writing code always follow the best practices for AdonisJS, InertiaJS, typescript and domain driven design. If you are unsure about anything search the web for best practices

- Whenever you make changes in the codebase try to following existing patterns
