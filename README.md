# FireKit Starter Template
This is a starter template that allows solo devs and entreprenuers to quickly get up and running with new apps.


### Why use this starter kit
AdonisJS is deeply inspired by the Laravel ecosystem. I love AdonisJS because it brings the speed and DX of Laravel combined with the power of Typescript. 

However there are still following features missing when starting a Adonis project, compared to starting a Laravel project. This starter template aims to bridge that gap. It is an opinionated take on helping devs quickly get started with building apps

### What will you get out of this starter template

- A completely working and functional session based auth system, with login, registration and forget password functionality included 
- InertiaJS is preconfigured in this project with React.
- A authenticated dashboard page with a proper navigation system and sidebar app layout
- ShadCN has been included as a baseline component library
